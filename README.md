## Notes

## Challenges
 ### One thing I learnt which wasn't there in the video/slides was the option 'Synchronize' right after adding code in build.gradle.
 ### The app was crashing often after I removed todoItems = new ArrayList<String>(); so I had to restart it.
 ### I had to read up on how ArrayList, ArrayAdapter work, whilst debugging errors. 
 ### It was a good experience designing the app and following instructions which were very well designed.
